# Note-Taker Application

## Description
This application was dessigned for the user to be able to create, save, and delete notes. The application runs on the local host and is deployed via Heroku and GitHub. 

## Technology Used
This application was built using express.js. We are using javascript files to handle the routing of the webpages and a db.json file used to store the information written on the notes. 

## Problems Faced
I initally had trouble correctly routing from page to page. My application will now load on the local host, save the notes, but not display them on that same webpage.

## Future Innovations
I am in the process of getting the webpage to display the notes that the user inputs.
